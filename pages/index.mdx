# Introduction
 
Welcome to Replicated Security docs page!

To avoid further confusion, we need to inform you that Replicated Security has more than one alias. The two most popular ones are `Interchain Security (ICS)`, `Cross-chain Validation (CCV)` - you might see them used on twitter and in various blog posts.

TODO: other definitions here?

# Synopsis

Replicated security is designed to replicate the security and decentralization of a validator set across multiple blockchains.
That is, a "provider chain" such as the Cosmos Hub can share its exact validator set with multiple consumer chains by communicating changes in its validator set over IBC.
Provider delegators and validators are held accountable for infractions like equivocation by allowing consumer chains to tombstone validators over IBC. See [this blog post](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing) for more details.
