# Introduction
 
Welcome to Replicated Security docs page!

To avoid further confusion, we need to inform you that Replicated Security has more than one alias. The two most popular ones are `Interchain Security (ICS)`, `Cross-chain Validation (CCV)` - you might see them used on twitter and in various blog posts.

# Synopsis
CCV stands for cross chain validation and refers to the subset of Interchain Security related to the staking and slashing communication between the provider and consumer blockchains.
The provider blockchain communicates staking changes to consumer blockchain(s), while the consumer blockchain may communicate slashing evidence to the provider blockchain.
